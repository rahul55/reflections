When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping everything local?
For backup reasons, and so others can access/ edit.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes I may not be done with a change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones within github. Clones are copies made from machine to machine or machine to github. Branches
are different ways the software is developing.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can be aware of the latest changes, and then work on an up-to-date version offline if you need.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using github would make things much easier. It may take getting used to but everything is easily visible from the screen
so there's no need of keeping track with a command line.
