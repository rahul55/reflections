When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping everything local?
For backup reasons, and so others can access/ edit.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes I may not be done with a change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones within github. Clones are copies made from machine to machine or machine to github. Branches
are different ways the software is developing.
