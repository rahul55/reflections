What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It gives a message saying it's initializing the repository when you run 'git init'. You need to do it in order to be able to create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle ground so you can see exactly what's going into the
next commit without having to move stuff around in your directory.
